TrainAppAssignment
==================

This program is created to learn about Git versioning and managing repositories with Visual Studio 2013. This is an assignment for programming in C.

THINGS TO DO:

1. Design basic data structure(graph seems to be the best at the moment... Please comment..)
2. Use suitable gui framework (C itself does not have GUI.)

Commited using VS 2013... Lazy to do console way... :D
